AbNormal
================================
AbNormal is a Pet Mod on Smogon's forum's Other Meta's section.
Introduction
--------------------------------
This Pet Mod aims to replace the Normal type completely, in a community project format. Thus meaning, every Normal type must have their types changed. There will be various phases which each allow different options to post. *[(directly from original thread)][1]*
